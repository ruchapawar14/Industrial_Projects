# 🔐 File Packer & Unpacker with Encryption

> A Java-based utility to pack multiple files into a single encrypted archive and unpack them back safely.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**File Packer & Unpacker with Encryption** is a Java-based file utility that allows users to:

- Pack multiple files into one archive
- Store metadata (file name, size, etc.)
- Encrypt data for security
- Unpack files back to original form

This project demonstrates core concepts of **Java File Handling, I/O Streams, Encryption, and Metadata Management**.
